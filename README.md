Introduction
A scorecard model is a powerful tool used to assess and quantify credit risk for various financial applications. This repository serves as a central hub for our scorecard model, detailing its development process, implementation, and performance evaluation.

Getting Started
To get started with the scorecard model, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the appropriate directories to access model development, implementation, and evaluation resources.
Repository Structure
data/: This directory contains datasets used for training and testing the scorecard model.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks illustrating the step-by-step process of model development and evaluation.
scripts/: Scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model deployment.
docs/: Additional documentation and reference materials.
Usage
Detailed usage instructions and examples can be found in the notebooks/ directory. Follow the notebooks to understand how to preprocess data, build the scorecard model, and assess its performance.

Model Development
The model development process is outlined in the notebooks/ directory. It includes:
